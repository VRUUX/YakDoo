3. **No Tracking Responsibility** - External sites handle their own tracking
4. **No Complex Compliance** - Simple disclosure is sufficient

### **‚úÖ What You DO Need:**

1. **Clear Disclosure** - Inform users they're leaving your site
2. **Privacy Policy Coverage** - Explain external link practices
3. **User Awareness** - Make it clear external sites have different policies
4. **Optional Analytics** - Track link clicks (with consent) for insights

### **üéØ Best Practices for External Links:**

```html
<!-- Example: Google Maps link -->
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=YOUR_ADDRESS" 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   title="Opens Google Maps in new window">
   Get Directions on Google Maps
</a>

<!-- Example: External blog link -->
<a href="https://external-blog.com/article" 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   title="Opens external website in new window">
   Read Full Article
</a>
```

### **üìä Optional Analytics Tracking:**

```javascript
// Track external link clicks (with consent)
function trackExternalLink(url, linkType) {
    if (window.VRUUX_GTM && typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
        gtag('event', 'external_link_click', {
            'link_url': url,
            'link_type': linkType, // 'maps', 'blog', 'social', etc.
            'link_destination': new URL(url).hostname
        });
    }
}
```
